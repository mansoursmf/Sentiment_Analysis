# Sentiment_Analysis
A project from MIT-6.86X-MachineLearning Using Perceptron and Pegasos linear classifier algorithms.


The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. 
Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. 
The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

Below are two example entries from our dataset. 
Each entry consists of the review and its label. The two reviews were written by different customers describing their experience with a sugar-free candy.



Tasks: 


Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: 
        the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.



Set Up:

project1.py contains various useful functions and function templates that you will use to implement your learning algorithms.

main.py is a script where these functions are called and you can run your experiments.

utils.py contains utility functions.

test.py is a script which runs tests on a few of the methods you will implement. 
  Feel free to add more test cases to further validate the correctness of your code.
